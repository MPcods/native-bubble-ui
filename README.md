# native-bubble-ui
A fully native Android UI system built with C++17, NativeActivity, EGL, and OpenGL ES 2.0.

Features an animated floating bubble button, a radial menu with multiple buttons, touch hit-testing, custom shaders, and a modular multi-file architecture.
Designed as an example of complex Android UI without Java Views — rendering, input handling, animations, and layout are all implemented in C++.
